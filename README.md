# This website shows my work experiance with some website examples

## Description

This repository houses the refactored code for a previously non-semantic web page. The refactoring process involved replacing the HTML elements with semantic tags to enhance its readability and accessibility. 

### Purpose

The primary goals of this refactoring process were:
1. **Enhance Accessibility**: Implementing semantic HTML ensures the content is more accessible, benefitting users with disabilities.
2. **SEO Optimization**: Semantic tags can lead to improved search engine rankings.
3. **Maintainability**: Semantic HTML makes the codebase easier to read and maintain.

### Changes Made

- Replaced generic `<div>` tags with semantic tags such as `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<main>`.
- Images now include `alt` attributes to improve screen reader accessibility.
- Introduced the `<figure>` element for better representation of images.
